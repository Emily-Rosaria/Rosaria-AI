# Rosaria-AI
Rosaria-AI is a simple bot made to enhance the discord servers of my friends and me. I don't currently have any intention of making it super available for others, but if you wanna use my source code, go for it. I got a lot of help from this repository: https://github.com/bredmor/simple-discord-js-bot.

Note, I'm not going to make the instance of my bot that I'm running on my VPS available for public use anytime soon, but I may consider adding it to your server if we're friends or something. That said, if you wanna try it yourself, I recommend using https://repl.it/ to experiment.
