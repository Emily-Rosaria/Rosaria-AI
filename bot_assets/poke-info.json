The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight.

It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.","Squirtle’s shell is not merely used for protection. The shell’s rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.","Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon’s toughness as a battler.","Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.","Its body is soft and weak. In nature, its perpetual fate is to be seen by others as food.","Its hard shell doesn’t crack a bit even if Pikipek pecks at it, but it will tip over, spilling out its insides.","Nectar from pretty flowers is its favorite food.

It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).","Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.","Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.","Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.","Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This Pokémon flies around, patrolling its living space.

Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.","This Pokémon is common but hazardous. Its sharp incisors can easily cut right through hard wood.","Its whiskers are essential for maintaining its balance. No matter how friendly you are, it will get angry and bite you if you touch its whiskers.","Due to its short wings, it can’t fly long distances. It wanders about restlessly and pecks at bug Pokémon.","In Alola, fish Pokémon are its prey. It can be seen circling above the ocean searching for food.","The eggs of bird Pokémon are its favorite food. It swallows eggs whole, so sometimes an egg gets stuck, and Ekans faints.","After stunning its opponents with the pattern on its stomach, it quickly wraps them up in its body and waits for them to stop moving.","While sleeping, it generates electricity in the sacs in its cheeks. If it’s not getting enough sleep, it will be able to use only weak electricity.","Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu looks, you don’t see this Pokémon very often.","When its skin gets wrinkled from moisture, it heads for a volcano.

There are plenty of Sandslash that park themselves in trees and go right to sleep.","Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon.

This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.","Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon’s notice.","Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might.","Nidoking’s thick tail packs enormously destructive power. With one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once this Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.","Bathed in moonlight, its wings glow faintly. Without even flapping, Clefairy rises into the air, where it dances around.","Some scientists believe that it gazes intently at the sky on nights with a full moon because it’s homesick.","It manipulates balls of fire to catch its prey. If you raise one from when it’s young, it will grow close to you like a puppy Pokémon.","The flickering flames it spews from its mouth leave its opponents hypnotized. Then, this extremely intelligent Pokémon attacks.","The songs they sing are totally different depending on the region they live in.

The rise in its body temperature helps its digestion.","The wastewater coming from factories is clean these days, so Grimer have nothing to eat.

Gengar will lurk in whatever dark corner of a room it can find and wait for its chance to catch its prey.","Onix has a magnet in its brain. It acts as a compass so that this Pokémon does not lose direction while it is tunneling.

It seems that bad dreams taste sour, so Drowzee doesn’t particularly like eating them.","There are some Hypno that assist doctors with patients who can’t sleep at night in hospitals.","Krabby live on beaches, burrowed inside holes dug into the sand. On sandy beaches with little in the way of food, these Pokémon can be seen squabbling with each other over territory.","Kingler has an enormous, oversized claw.

However, it’s clear that it’s always crying.","They thump their bones rhythmically to communicate among themselves.

This Pokémon has an indomitable spirit and will never give up in the face of adversity.","It licks filth clean with its tongue. Whatever it licks always stinks afterward, so whether it’s really clean is...questionable.","Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly powerful poison gas.

The more the gases are mixed, the more powerful the toxins become. The Pokémon also becomes more putrid.","Rhyhorn’s brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run it forgets why it started running in the first place. It apparently remembers sometimes if it demolishes something.","Rhydon has a horn that serves as a drill.

This Pokémon occasionally rams into streams of magma, but the armor-like hide prevents it from feeling the heat.","Because the eggs on their bellies have been overharvested by people in the past, the Chansey population remains very small.","Tangela’s vines snap off easily if they are grabbed.

There are some musicians who compose songs for Jynx to sing.","While it’s often blamed for power outages, the truth is the cause of outages is more often an error on the part of the electric company.","The hotter the place, the better they feel.

It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people.","In battle, Chikorita waves its leaf around to keep the foe at bay. However, a sweet fragrance also wafts from the leaf, becalming the battling Pokémon and creating a cozy, friendly atmosphere all around.","Bayleef’s neck is ringed by curled-up leaves.

In battle, this Pokémon gives off more of its becalming scent to blunt the foe’s fighting spirit.","Cyndaquil protects itself by flaring up the flames on its back. The flames are vigorous if the Pokémon is angry.

If it senses the approach of strong winds, Hoppip links its leaves with other Hoppip to prepare against being blown away.","Skiploom’s flower blossoms when the temperature rises above 64 degrees Fahrenheit.

The Pokémon descends to the ground when it encounters cold air while it is floating.","It searches for prey from the tops of trees. When it spots its favorite food, Bounsweet, Aipom gets excited and pounces.","Sunkern tries to move as little as it possibly can. It does so because it tries to conserve all the nutrients it has stored in its body for its evolution.

People use it to mark the seasons.","They migrate according to the seasons, so some people call Sawsbuck the harbingers of spring.","As it flies, it scatters electricity around, so bird Pokémon keep their distance.

When it’s finished digging, it lounges lazily.","Its body is always warm. Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with it in their bed.","Its speed right after takeoff already puts it in the top speed class of all bird Pokémon.","Bird Pokémon make up most of its diet. It approaches at high speeds and smacks them down to the ground with its powerful kick.","The powder that covers its body regulates its temperature, so it can live in any region or climate.","The beaks of bird Pokémon can’t begin to scratch its stalwart body.

This Pokémon prefers to eat raw meat.","Flabébé wears a crown made from pollen it’s collected from its flower. The crown has hidden healing properties.","It gives its own power to flowers, pouring its heart into caring for them. Floette never forgives anyone who messes up a flower bed.","Its life can span several hundred years.
